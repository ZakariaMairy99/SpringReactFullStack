# Employee Management Full-Stack Application

## Project Overview

This project is a **full-stack application** for employee management, built with a **Spring Boot backend**, a **React frontend**, and **MySQL** for data storage. The application enables users to perform **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employee records, such as adding new employees, viewing employee lists, updating employee information, and deleting employee records. **Postman** is used for testing and verifying API endpoints during development. The design emphasizes **modularity**, **maintainability**, and **responsiveness**, providing a smooth user experience and efficient management of employee data.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot 3**: The backend framework used for building RESTful APIs.
- **Spring Data JPA (Hibernate 6)**: A Java persistence framework for interacting with the MySQL database.
- **MySQL**: Database used for storing employee data.
- **IntelliJ IDEA**: IDE used for developing the Spring Boot backend.
- **Maven**: Build automation tool used for dependency management and project build.
- **Postman**: API testing tool used to verify API endpoints during development.
- **React.js 18+**: The frontend framework for building a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Vite.js**: A build tool used to bundle and serve the React frontend during development.
- **Bootstrap CSS**: Frontend framework used for responsive design and styling of the application.
- **JavaScript**: Programming language used for frontend logic and interactions.
- **npm**: Package manager for managing JavaScript dependencies.
- **VS Code IDE**: IDE used for developing the React frontend.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client used for making API requests from React to the backend.

## Project Architecture

- **Frontend**: React.js (with Vite.js for bundling) is used to create a responsive and interactive user interface.
- **Backend**: Spring Boot 3 serves as the backend API, managing CRUD operations on employee data and interacting with the MySQL database.
- **Database**: MySQL is used for persistent storage of employee data, and Spring Data JPA handles database operations using Hibernate ORM.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete employee records.
- **User Interface**: Clean and responsive UI for managing employees.
- **API Testing**: Postman is used to test API endpoints.
- **Efficient Management**: Smooth user experience for managing employee data.
